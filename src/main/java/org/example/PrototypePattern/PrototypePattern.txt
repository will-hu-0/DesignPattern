Lets understand this pattern using an example. I am creating an entertainment application that will require instances of Movie,
Album and Show classes very frequently. I do not want to create their instances everytime as it is costly.
So, I will create their prototype instances, and everytime when i will need a new instance,
I will just clone the prototype.
